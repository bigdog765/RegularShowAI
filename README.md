# AI-Driven Regular Show Discord Bot

A fun, real-time interactive experience that brings Mordecai & Rigby to life in your Discord server! Inspired by the ‚ÄúAI Sponge‚Äù stream, this project replaces Spongebob with Regular Show characters‚Äîcombining a Discord bot, Python AI scripting, and a Unity scene (with Blender models & animations) to generate dynamic skits on any user-provided topic.
